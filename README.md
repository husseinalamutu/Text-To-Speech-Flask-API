# Text-To-Speech-Flask-API

This repository provides a step-by-step tutorial for building a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) API using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. The API converts text input into audio output, enabling users to interact with the service programmatically.

## Features

* **Text-to-Speech Conversion** : Converts plain text into speech in various languages and voices.
* **RESTful API** : Exposes the TTS functionality as a web service that can be accessed over HTTP.
* **Customization** : Supports multiple languages and voices for TTS generation.
* **Audio Output** : Returns audio in formats such as MP3 or WAV.

## Requirements

To follow this tutorial and run the TTS API, youâ€™ll need the following:

* Python 3.7+ (preferably in a virtual environment)
* Flask
* gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
